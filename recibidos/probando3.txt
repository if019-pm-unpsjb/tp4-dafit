cosas, ignorar

Yeah, you try brush dirt off your shoulder
Keep on trying but you're getting older
Found truth, but you're getting colder
Try to fight the feeling, but it stays the same

(You know how to slap that bass, know what I'm sayin'?)
Keep parked up on your throne
Can't find some time alone
Just please turn off your phone
Please clean up your act 'cause you look like a clown

(Yeah, yeah)
Please clean up your act 'cause you look like a clown
Yeah, got no pot to piss in

me mande una cagada y se corto xd nueva letra

Goddamn, I love too hard
I love too hot, my love's a fire
Everything I claim to love's going up in flames and I burn alive
I gotta lay back in a straight jacket after sex and still inspired
And my friends will ask when I feel relaxed and I say
When I die (when I die)
I'll let go (I'll let go)
But in my life (in my life)
I hold on until there's nothing left to hold
And then, you know, I just explode
I'll explode
Goddamn, I run too fast towards the things that I adore
Everything I'm running for starts running from me (like I'm a zombie)
I gotta lay back, gotta get static, after Xanax I'm still wired
And my friends will ask when I feel relaxed and I say
When I die (when I die), I'll let go (I'll let go)
But in my life (in my life), I hold on until there's nothing left to hold
And then, you know, I just explode
I'll explode
I'll just (explode)
Until there's nothing left to blow
When I die, I'll let go
But in my life, I hold on until there's nothing left to hold
When I die (when I die), I'll let go (I'll let go)
But in my life (in my life), I hold on until there's nothing left to hold
And then, you know, I just explode
(In my life)
I'll explode (I'll let go)
But in my life (explode) (in my life)
I'll hold on until there's nothing left to hold
And then, you know, I just explode

Baby love, baby child, you're gonna die
All your friends, all the flowers' gonna die
So why you so shy? Why you so shut off?
You're running out of time
I want you to fly, I want you to pop off
Way up into the sky
Mama always said, "You got to find yourself a mantra"
Fuck no
To living in a basement
Fuck no
To my one sweet life squeezed tight in a vice grip
Fuck no
To the 95 suicide, bleeding like a stuck pig
Fuck no, fuck no
Fuck no to living in the matrix
I forget all the time I'm gonna die
But then again, I'm divine, nobody dies
So why am I so stressed? Why am I so depressed?
I'm running out of time
Mama always said, "You got to find yourself a mantra"
Fuck no
To living in a basement
Fuck no
To my one sweet life squeezed tight in a vice grip
Fuck no
To the 95 suicide, bleeding like a stuck pig
Fuck no, fuck no
Fuck no to living in the matrix
My mama always said, "You got to find yourself a mantra"
Buddha said, Voodoo said, Guru said, Rumi said
All the Dalai Lamas, all the snake charmers
"You gotta get cosmic, gotta kiss God"
But papa always said, "Gotta find yourself a job"
But mama said, "Nah, gotta find yourself a mantra"
Fuck no
To living in a basement
Fuck no
To my one sweet life squeezed tight in a vice grip
Fuck no
To the 95 suicide, bleeding like a stuck pig
Fuck no, fuck no
Fuck no to living in the matrix
Fuck no (baby love, baby child)
Fuck no to living in the matrix
Fuck no (baby love, baby child)
Fucking no to my one sweet life squeezed tight in a vice grip
Fuck no (baby love, baby child)
To the 95 suicide, bleeding like a stuck pig
Fuck no, fuck no (baby love, baby child)
Fuck no to living in the matrix
